## Setup

    npm i

## Development

    npm start

Runs a development server at localhost:8080. The server is also accessible to other devices who are connected to the same network.

The address of the server on your local network depends on the IP of your machine but the port is the same as the localhost one. To get the address of the development server on your local network:

    npm run network-info
