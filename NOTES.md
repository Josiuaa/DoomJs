# Release Notes

## v 0.2.1 - 2018/08/18

* We have logging

The engine is now able to log messages at the top of the screen. The frame rate is now aligned with the right side of the screen.

Also, the color of both the frame rate and messages is red by default but will turn orange when viewing the automap.

## v 0.2.0 - 2018/08/18

* We have a music engine!

The engine will now start a random song from Doom or Doom II to give the game some atmosphere. For Chrome-specific reasons, the song will only start playing on the first click on the page.
